# Staffs AI

This is a repo that contains all work completed for the AI module during Semester 2 at Staffs Uni

This project implements A star pathfinding to move between designated nodes within the framework. It also contains a state machine that calculates the distance between the passenger and fuel, and seeks to whichever is closer based on their path.

The state machine also handles the behaviour of each car depending on which mode they are in, slowing their velocity if they are approaching the final node, or randomly selecting a point to "wander" to.

Instructions

The controls for the project are as follows:
S – Blue car seek
A – Blue car arrive
W – Red car wander
P – Blue car pursuit
F – Blue car flee
E – Blue car evade
Space – Red car path find
